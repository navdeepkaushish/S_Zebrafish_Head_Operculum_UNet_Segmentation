# zebrafish_image_segmentation

**Modified UNet for Zebrafish head and operculum segmentation**

**_Description_**
- Data folder contains the test images
- Models folder contains the trained models directly used for testing
- Model architecture is defined in _unet_modified.py_ 
- Main file is _run.py_
- All the supporting functions are written in _utils.py_
